/**
 *  An implementation of {@link ExecutorService}, enabling the caller to stipulate an
 *  explicit ordering of submitted tasks on a basis of a free-form key, defining a 
 *  partial execution order of tasks among their peers. <p>
 *  
 *  The caller can specify the desired level of parallelism by calling 
 *  {@link ExecutorOptions#setParallelism(int)} before instantiating the 
 *  {@link LinearExecutor}. <p>
 *  
 *  Tasks are conventional {@link Runnable} and {@link Callable} derivatives, having also 
 *  implemented a conditionally optional {@link LinearTask} decorator interface. The latter 
 *  exposes a single string-based 'key', that forms a logical association among the
 *  submitted tasks sharing the same key. For any given key, tasks will be executed
 *  serially, in the strict order of task submission to the {@link LinearExecutor}. In other
 *  words, tasks sharing a common key are totally ordered. No relative order is imposed on
 *  tasks with differing keys â€” they may execute in parallel and in arbitrary order relative
 *  to one another, as per conventional thread-pooled behaviour. <p>
 *  
 *  While the developer can subclass {@link LinearTask} to decorate submissions, the recommended
 *  (and easiest) way to submit ordered tasks is to wrap conventional {@link Runnable}s and 
 *  {@link Callable}s using the {@link LinearRunnable#decorate(Runnable, String)} and 
 *  {@link LinearCallable#decorate(Callable, String)} helper methods. <p>
 *  
 *  Ordinarily, submitted tasks <em>should</em> implement the {@link LinearTask} interface; 
 *  however, this is not mandatory by default. The {@link LinearExecutor} intentionally permits
 *  unordered tasks, thereby allowing the application to submit mixed workloads without
 *  either needing to explicitly assign a key for those tasks where execution order is 
 *  irrelevant, or forcing the application to employ a separate {@link ExecutorService}
 *  for those tasks. (Behind the scenes, this implementation actually derives a key using
 *  the task's hash code if the task fails to implement {@link LinearTask}, which may or may
 *  not be pseudo-random, depending on whether the task has chosen to override 
 *  {@link Object#hashCode()}.) Additionally, permitting non-linear tasks by default ensures
 *  that {@link LinearExecutor} remains strictly compliant with the broader {@link ExecutorService}
 *  interface semantics, and allows it to effectively substitute any other 
 *  {@link ExecutorService} implementation. <p>
 *  
 *  The default behaviour of allowing non-{@link LinearTask} submissions may be overridden by
 *  calling {@link ExecutorOptions#setAllowNonLinearTasks(boolean)}, in which case they will be
 *  denied with a {@link RejectedExecutionException} upon submission. This <em>should</em> be
 *  done in scenarios where the application wishes to mandate ordered execution and does not 
 *  foresee mixed task types. <p>
 *  
 *  The {@link LinearExecutor} is backed by the <b>Indigo</b> dynamic actor system, which
 *  provides highly efficient lock-free task queueing and non-blocking thread scheduling
 *  mechanics. Indigo is utilised partially; {@link LinearExecutor} does not require
 *  fully-fledged actor system semantics, such as actor-to-actor communication, message 
 *  exchange patterns, stashing, actor life-cycle management, throttling, dead-letter queues, 
 *  and so forth. <p>
 *  
 *  Behind the scenes, tasks are assigned to sporadic actors based on a task's key. Tasks are 
 *  packaged as Indigo messages and queued on the actors' local mailboxes. An ephemeral
 *  actor is created for every unique key; the actor is automatically passivated when its
 *  mailbox is emptied, and may be re-activated if new messages arrive. The actors act as agents, 
 *  executing the payload of the message, moving on to the next message, etc. In spite of the
 *  underlying complexity, the actor semantics are completely hidden from the application; 
 *  the latter perceives {@link LinearExecutor} as a yet another {@link ExecutorService}, 
 *  albeit one that can recognise and administer a partial ordering among submitted tasks. <p>
 *
